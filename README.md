##  Overview

**MacroPad** is a 4by4 keyboard which uses hotswappable mechanical switches and uses a micro-controller
so that it can be used a stream deck as well as the indivisual keys are programmable manually in the firmware 
folder 

## PCB design :

this pcb design is the design layout ony for the hot swapable keys and the rest of the conponents can be placed at the bottom of the pcb here :

## PCB front side :

this is the pcb in 3d view and the components can be seen placed in there respective places, there are places to put in indivisual 
led aswell to make the macro pad backlit as well 

## PCB backside :
