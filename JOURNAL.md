I managed to finish the schematics 3d model of the case, pcb design and everything in this past week, I decided to finish everything in one go then upload it all. I have taken help of one of my brothers to write the firmware as well, which maybe needed to be configured later on. I hope this is enough software so that now I can finally start on the hardware side of things
